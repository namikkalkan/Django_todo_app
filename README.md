# Django_todo_app
This project includes basic understanding of Django 


Notes to pay attention.
-For each created model like Todo remember to add and register 
-In settings.py you need to address templates folder
-First url.py (create path for url and function) 
  Views.py create function with request in it and return render that with html file.
  Html you can use {{context}} which you inserted in views and also {% if %} etc functions.
